## Cloud Computing Concepts
Cloud computing is a network-based usage model that is billed according to usage. It can be introduced from both narrow and broad perspectives:
- **Narrow Cloud Computing** refers to the delivery and usage model of IT infrastructure, where resources are obtained as needed and in a scalable manner over the network.
- **Broad Cloud Computing** refers to the delivery and usage model of services, where services are obtained as needed and in a scalable manner over the network. These services can be related to IT and software, the internet, or any other kind of service, offering unique benefits such as massive scale, virtualization, and secure reliability.

### Value
Cloud computing brings both technological and business model innovations:  
&emsp;&emsp;**Technological Innovation:** Cloud Computing = Virtualization + Cluster Management  
&emsp;&emsp;**Business Innovation:** Transition from "purchasing hardware and software products" to "purchasing information services"  
The value of cloud computing is reflected in:

### Development
The development of cloud computing has gone through parallel computing, distributed computing, and grid computing. It is the result of the integration of multiple computing models, network storage, virtualization, load balancing, and other traditional computer and network technologies. The main computing models in its evolution are analyzed as follows:

|       Computing Model       | Definition | Characteristics |
|:--------------------------:|:----------:|:----------------:|
|  Parallel Computing        | Using multiple computing resources simultaneously to solve a computational problem, primarily aimed at quickly solving large and complex problems | Assigns computational tasks to multiple processing units within the system |
| Distributed Computing      | Breaking down a problem requiring immense computational power into smaller parts, distributing them across multiple computers for processing, and combining the results to get the final outcome | Assigns computational tasks to multiple independent machines in the network |
| Grid Computing             | Using the internet to link geographically distributed resources into a logical whole, akin to a supercomputer | A type of distributed computing that provides integrated information and application services to users |

### Service Models: XaaS
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):**  
&emsp;&emsp;SaaS software is "ready to use" without requiring user installation, and software upgrades and maintenance do not need end-user involvement. It also offers the unmatched advantage of on-demand usage, compared to traditional software purchases which cannot be returned.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  
&emsp;&emsp;In addition to providing basic computing capabilities, PaaS includes a business development environment, offering IT components such as application code, SDKs, operating systems, and APIs. These are available for individual developers and enterprises to embed corresponding functional modules into software or hardware, improving development efficiency.

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**  
&emsp;&emsp;IaaS aggregates IT infrastructure resources (computing, networking, storage) into a resource pool through virtualization and dynamization. Users can obtain the computing resources they need over the network to run their business systems.

### Major Service Providers
Major cloud computing providers, both domestic and international, include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, and Huawei Cloud. International cloud service providers focus on leveraging their cloud strengths and cooperating with telecom operators for network capabilities, while domestic providers comprehensively build cloud backbones (self-built) and cloud access networks, expanding their global infrastructure and impacting the dedicated line market of telecom operators.
